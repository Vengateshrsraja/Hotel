                    Event Staff, Medical Staff and Dungeon Monitors are here to work for your safety and enjoyment of the event.
                    If you have any issues we can help you with, please feel free to let us know by alerting either a Senior Event Staff member, a Dungeon Monitor or by coming to the Public Safety Room (at NE that will be the Executive Board Room 2nd floor).
                    We ask that any directives issued by the Senior Staff be followed without question or discussion.
                    Failure to obey Senior Event Staff or Dungeon Monitors as stated above may result in your removal from the event without refund.
                    If you have an issue with any interaction with the Event Staff, please feel free to bring it to the attention of the Coordination Staff.
                    Off-duty Event Staff may not be wearing their staff shirts or staff badges and may reasonably request that you take questions and concerns to on-duty Event Staff.
                    Senior Event Staff will have a ribbon designating them as such and you may approach them at any time whether they are on or off duty, though we ask that you do so with some consideration.
                    Photography and cell phone use are allowed at our events, with the following limitations. Violation of these limitations will result in your immediate removal from the event without refund, and possible banning from all future THE events. THE adheres to an Opt-in philosophy.

                <p>
                    Please be polite and keep a reasonable distance from scenes and Workshops you’re not a part of.
                    If you wish to observe a scene but not participate, seating areas will be made available for that purpose.
                    Observation areas are not for socializing and we ask you to keep any conversations or comments short and quiet.
                    Do not block walkways, exits or other equipment with yourself or your possessions.
                    DMs will ask you to be quieter or move if they deem you to be a disruption or in the way.
                    Do not touch other people without permission. Seriously, don’t do it.
                    Do not touch other people’s toys, toy bags or other personal belongings without explicit permission.
                    If someone asks you to move further away from a scene or Workshop or to be quieter, please do so without discussion.
                    If you see safety issues in someone else’s play please let a DM know and they will intervene as they deem appropriate.
                    Be considerate in terms of the amount of time you spend on a piece of equipment. Monopolizing a frame, table or other equipment is not courteous.
                    If there are Workshops going on in the Outdoor Spaces, be courteous and do not engage in play right next to them or make excessive amounts of noise.
                    Please thoroughly clean the equipment after you use it and before you take your aftercare elsewhere.
                    Leave the equipment cleaned and ready for the next user, just as you would like to find it.
